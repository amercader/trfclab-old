Led by [Dr Moles](#about), the Tissue Remodelling, Fibrosis and Cancer group has a transversal approach to science, with an enthusiastic and highly skilled team of researchers that enjoy doing science together and learning from each other every day.

Our main research lines are:

1. Identification of central and common regulatory mechanisms of hepatic and renal fibrotic diseases.

2. Study of the proteolytic networks controlling the progression and reversion of liver and kidney fibrosis.

3. Analysis of the degradome associated with the development and progression of liver cancer.

4. Design of therapies modulating proteolytic networks as novel treatments for fibrosis and cancer.

Our line of research aims to increase our biological understanding around the complex interplay between the cells and the ECM that takes place during tissue remodelling in chronic diseases in order to discover new therapeutic targets for the treatment of fibrosis and cancer.
